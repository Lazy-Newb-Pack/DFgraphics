DFgraphics
==========

A collection of Dwarf Fortress graphics packs, configured for [Starter Packs]
(http://lazynewbpack.com/).

Current targeted version:  DF 0.40.24

Each graphics pack is set up to use the features of PyLNP 0.11a to save space by
omitting duplicate or vanilla files.  With the exception of ASCII-Default, they
also use [TWBT](https://github.com/mifki/df-twbt) to the greatest extent practical.

Graphics packs must consist of more than a tileset and color scheme, as PyLNP has
alternative management methods for those which are more flexible and take less space.

It is assumed that the mouse images, standard curses tilesets, and Meph's vanilla
TwbT overrides are placed in `LNP/Tilesets` to save space, as they are shared by
most graphics packs.
